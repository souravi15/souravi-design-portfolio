		<p class="competitive-research-info">In this process, client competitive research was conducted.A comparison revealed Floragogo as the only app providing service with swift delivery.It also had unique filtering process, that is other services do not filter by flower color, indeed providing more ease of use.</p>
		<p>To provide better customer experience, user personas was drafted based on app-usage scenarios.This helped to understand the different ocassions the user may need the app.
		A moonboard was designed to understand the brandâ€¨ better and provided basis for UI design process.</p>

				<p class="design-intro"><em>The User Experience </em>: a smooth transition from user signup upto the tracking of product after purchase was designed.
				<br/><br />All design requirements, along with the design constraints were taken under consideration. 
				<br/><br />	For example, the old logo(green bouquet),signup within two pages using google or facebook, florist affiliation in 2 pages, order tracking and so on. The visual theme was enhanced by designing according to the product by adding flowers to each view, keeping the colors in sync with logo at the same time making the whole design vibrant and attractive.

			<div class="flexb">
				<p class="filterintro"> One of the main requirements was to provide a good filter facility in the app. This was to ensure the uniqueness among different services available in the market.
				<br/><br />To further improve the UX, have ensured the user can change the given time and 
				address even after the initial selection page.It is done by providing icons of time and locator in the main product search page. This also applies for addition or removal of a product to ensure better usability.
